# TODOs for this project

While this project is a complete MVP for Beauty Med Spa, there are still some areas to improve upon if time permits.

## Frontend

- Authentication
- Uniform data caching and retrieval for all important/costly data operations
  - Consider using tanstack query for this
- Quick help/give feedback section in the site to answer questions
- Analytics built into the app, e.g. Posthog to understand user behavior and engagement
- Exporting data to CSV, Excel, etc.

## Backend

- Authentication
- Natural language query support for statistics using a query registry and tool execution
- Adding Unit and E2E tests to the API
- Adding logging and monitoring to the backend
- Adding rate limiting to the backend
